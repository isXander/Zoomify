## Secondary Zoom
This new feature is a completely separate zoom to normal Zoomify.
Its primary goal is to compete with a similar feature in
[Camera Utils](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/camera-utils) (with more settings of course)
that I have seen many content creators love.

All you need to do is press another keybinding found in options! (F6 by default)

This secondary zoom has a few exclusive features but misses advanced ones present in
regular zoom that aren't really needed for the intended use case. These include:

- Option to hide HUD whilst zooming
- Cinematic camera is always on
- An increased maximum zoom in time (5secs -> 30secs)
- Toggleable only
- No transitions - linear only
- No additional mouse settings

This feature came with a semi-major rewrite to the internals of Zoomify,
though you shouldn't notice a difference. If you do, make sure to report it on the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/isXander/Zoomify/issues).
