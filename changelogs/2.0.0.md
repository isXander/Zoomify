## Highlights

### Spyglass Integration

- `Zoom Behaviour` option. Controls if Zoomify can only be used
  with a spyglass or override the vanilla spyglass zoom.
- `Overlay Visibility` option controls when to render the
  spyglass overlay when zooming with Zoomify.
- `Sound Behaviour` option controls when to play the
  zoom in and out sounds of the spyglass.

### Relative View Bobbing

- Added `Relative View Bobbing` option which reduced the amount of bobbing
  depending on the zoom level to make walking less jarring.

### Zoom Speed Changes

- Remove `Zoom Speed` option in favour of `Zoom In Time` and `Zoom Out Time`
  which dictates amount of seconds it takes to do said action.
- Remove `Scroll Zoom Speed` option in favour of `Scroll Zoom Smoothness`.
  The higher the smoothness the longer and smoother the scrolling is.
